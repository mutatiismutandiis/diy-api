This project was introduced by the instructor as an exercise to build our own API RESTful and use it with Postman.
I decided to take the project further as an exercise:
- Filtered repeated jokes and added uuid. 
- Simple and responsive layout as frontend, designed using canvas, colors from color.hunt.co and background image created with patter.moster. 
- The user to use some of the original methods implemented in the original exercise: GET a random joke, Filter by type, PATCH and DELETE a joke, and POST a joke. In the files, you can also find a GET by id, PUT and DELETE all methods that were part as the original exercise commented out.
 The site is built with Node.js using Express, and deployed in render.com.
